        <title>Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Flint is a CMS built to be flexible, easy to use an super flexible. Your content needs to fit into more layouts and environments than anyone but you can plan for, so Flint enables you to make the templates you need and fill it with your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a CMS that is built for those who want to fully design the front-end of their website without wanting to deal with static site generators or older content management systems (that are slow and use outdated technology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every content management system falls into one of two categories: Can be customized a ton, but is very cumbersome to work with, or can be customized to little but is very straightforward. Only a few seem to find that perfect balance; &lt;a href=&quot;https://craftcms.com&quot;&gt;CraftCMS&lt;/a&gt;, which Flint is ultimately inspired by, is a great example. However, there are very few systems that take advantage of the performance of newer, “sexier” stacks that employ Node.js. Flint is really fast and is written using modern web standards so that newer developers can jump in, plus it’s open source so more and more people can help make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Users</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike other content managment systems, Flint comes with unlimited usergroups for free. This means that as far as templating goes, there is only one type of user with potentially different usergroups (which makes templating easy to plan for).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time the server is restarted, Flint checks to see if there is an Admin usergroup and, if necessary, creates one with all permission enabled. Deleting the Admin usergroup is disabled in the dashboard, but in case someone does it by mistake directly through the database or some other horrible mistake happens, Flint has you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-registration&quot;&gt;Public Registration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some websites need for their users to be able to signup for the site, rather than being given an account. In your Flint site’s settings (under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Settings/Site Settings&lt;/code&gt;) you can enable or disable the endpoints that allow for form or AJAX inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
